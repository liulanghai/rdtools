## Detailed Description

**RdTools** is the ultimate productivity companion for modern web developers. Stop switching between multiple browser tabs or external sites to format JSON, convert timestamps, or encode strings. RdTools brings essential debugging utilities directly into your browser’s **Side Panel**, providing a seamless, high-performance workflow.

### 🚀 Key Purpose
RdTools is designed to solve the common "precision loss" and "context switching" problems developers face during API debugging and data manipulation. From handling massive IDs (BigInt) to exploring deeply nested JSON strings, RdTools ensures your data remains accurate and accessible.

### 🔥 Featured Tools

#### 1. Advanced JSON Editor (High Precision)
*   **BigInt Data Safety**: No more truncated IDs! RdTools preserves the precision of long integers (16+ digits) like Snowflake IDs, which standard JS tools often break.
*   **Intelligent Search**: Find keys or values instantly with character-level highlighting. The tool automatically expands parent nodes to reveal hidden matches.
*   **Auto-Nested Parsing**: Detected a JSON-serialized string inside a value? RdTools parses it recursively so you can explore it as a sub-tree.
*   **Dual-Mode Editing**: Edit simple values inline or use the formatted Modal editor for long strings and nested objects.
*   **Validation**: Real-time syntax highlighting and error messaging for invalid JSON inputs.

#### 2. Unix Timestamp Converter
*   Seamlessly convert between Unix timestamps (seconds & milliseconds) and local human-readable date strings.
*   One-click "Current Time" retrieval for quick reference.

#### 3. Base64 & Encoding Tools
*   High-speed Base64 encoding and decoding.
*   Full **Unicode/UTF-8 support**, ensuring your special characters and emojis are never garbled.

#### 4. Authorization Header Generator
*   Instantly generate standard `Basic Auth` headers for your API calls.

### 💻 Seamless Integration
*   **Side Panel First**: Optimized specifically for the Chrome Side Panel, allowing you to debug alongside your active tab without losing focus.
*   **Vertical Layout**: Designed with a stack-based layout to maximize vertical space, perfect for side-by-side work.
*   **Developer-Centric UX**: 1-second "Copy Result" toast, "Prettify" shortcuts, and a dark, high-contrast UI that matches your code editor.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
